## insanj.com

Complete personal website, including assets and external resources. Includes [Catalyst](http://insanj.com/catalyst), [Circlet](http://insanj.com/circlet), [Colendar](http://insanj.com/colendar), and [Orangered](http://insanj.com/orangered). Head over to the [Repository](https://github.com/insanj/repository) for my Cydia Repos. This website has existed for as long as I've been on the internet, and previously  merged with my blog (which has now been consumed [by Medium](https://medium.com/@insanj)). You can get a peek at this evolution using [the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110704211307/http://www.insanj.com/).

Also contains [lifeiscontent](https://github.com/lifeiscontent)'s responsive [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) [fork](https://github.com/lifeiscontent/sleepyti.me) (use it, if you want!).
